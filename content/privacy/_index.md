1. Information we collect:

    - Your HTTP and DNS query, including its response

    - Your Internet Protocol (IP) address

    - The version of your browser or client software

    We store these data in our log files in order to monitor the health of our services. We regularly clean up old logs so these data are only stored temporarily.

2. Information we share:

    - GeoDNS service uses your geographical information to determine servers that are faster and have lower latency to you. To make GeoDNS work, we send part of your IP address (/24 for IPv4, /48 for IPv6 by default) to authoritive and recursive domain name servers. You may opt out this behavior if you use `doh-client` by setting `no_ecs = true`. Please note that /24 is not enough to track a single user, although it is precise enough to determine your geographical location.

    - We reserve the right to share your personal information for legal reasons, including but not limited to:

        1. investigate potential violations of Terms of Service.

        2. protect against harm to our safety and rights of other users and us.
        
        3. detect, prevent, address, or investigate fraud, security or technical issues.

        4. meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.

    - We cannot share any information we do not have, or have not stored, or have erased in prior.

3. Cookies

    Currently we do not actively use Cookie in our website or our DNS service. However we use third-party Content Delivery Network (CDN) services, which may use Cookie or other technolgies to enhanse user experiences or to protect the service from network attacks.

4. Third-party services

    We may use third-party services, including CDN or DNS services. While we do our best to protect users from having privacy harmed by them, please check their Privacy Policies for more information.

    In case of a network attack, including but no limited to a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, these third-party services may increase its data collection level in order to determine good users from bad users by tracking users.

5. Changes

    Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. In case of a change, we would post a notice on our website.

6. Service termination

    You may choose to terminate the utilization of our service, and write to us to request deletion of your data. Please note that this is at best-effort, since most data are anonymised and we may not be able to find all data related to you.

7. Contact

    Feel free to write to the “dns” mailbox of “dns-over-https.com” in case of anything you want to tell us.
